lab6 is base on lab5 and further developped, so if you want lab5, you can find them in lab6.

Below is the project proposal: 
1. Title of your project : hunting start!
 2. Game front page

		Player’s name in defender
		player’s name in attacker 
		chat room
3. Game play page 
• Describe the game, how to play it, how to win/lose
	Defender has to survive in the gaming area in 2 minutes.
	
	Meanwhile, attacker will keep buying some items/monster to attack defender.
	
	Defender have to kill the monster or dodge the items meanwhile he/she has to keep collecting coins which randomly generated ion the gaming area and increase their mark.
	
	If defender get hit by three time , then defender die and exchange the role with attacker.
	
	If defender did not die, then defender will exchange with attacker and play again to see whose mark is higher to determine the winner.
